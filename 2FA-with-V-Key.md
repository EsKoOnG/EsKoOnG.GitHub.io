# V-OS Cloud Authentication
<p>Deployed from V-OS Cloud, a customisable app is configured to your organisational needs
and is individualized for each employee. The cloud platform provides operational efficiency
in the deployment of Trusted Identity services. It also optimises the cost of implementation
and maintenance, and focuses on ensuring usability on any IOS or Android device.</p>

through the V-Key App
5. When the 2FA is successfully verified, user will be able to access the services
